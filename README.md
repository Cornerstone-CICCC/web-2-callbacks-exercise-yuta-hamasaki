# Web Dev 2 - Callback Exercise

## Instructions

1. Modify `file_reader.js` so that it can read the data from:
  
    - firstname.txt
    - lastname.txt
    - age.txt
    - hobbies.txt

2. Using **callback functions**, read one file at a time and at the end, console.log the sentence `John Smith is 50 years old and his hoobies are swimming and dancing` on the terminal
3. Commit and push your changes

## Notes

Convert the data inside `hobbies.txt` to an array and select each hobby using their index. For example, `hobbies[0]` and `hobbies[1]`
